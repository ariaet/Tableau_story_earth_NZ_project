Project Overview

This project utilises Tableau, a data analysis and visualisation tool, to present an in depth analysis of earthquake data in New Zealand.

Data 

The USGS reports on earthquakes from 1960 to 2023 

Problem Statement

The challenge is to thoroughly investigate key earthquake indicators and extract valuable insights into the phenomenon. This analysis requires the creation of comprehensive data visualisations that provide a clear understanding of the different aspects of the data. 

Results:

Key indicators were analysed to provide insight into the nature of earthquakes. In particular, the following indicators were analysed:

1. Map of earthquakes by magnitude. 

2. Earthquake statistics by year with notes on technical innovations in seismology.

3. The frequency of earthquakes on the Richter scale is displayed, and key earthquakes in the history of earthquakes in NZ in recent years are labelled. 

4. Exploring the interplay of earthquake magnitude and depth
